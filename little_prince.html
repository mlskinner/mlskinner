<p class="body">As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class = "underline"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span> <span class = "highlight-text">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class = "colored-text" >What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class = "colored-text">“What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower to a flower—the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…”</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class= "underline"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…”</span></p>
